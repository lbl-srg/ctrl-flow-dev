## Starting the development server

1. Install Docker on your machine.
1. Copy the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`. In the newly created file, change the value of `NODE_ENV` to be `development`.
1. Run `npm install` to install NPM dependencies.
1. Run `npm run docker:start` to start the Node application in Docker. If you haven't built the Docker image before, this might take several minutes. Once the image is ready, the container outputs logs from the development server in the terminal. The container is set up to add a couple of crucial dependencies to the environment for the service to work properly:

   - Modelica dependencies.
   - Pandoc CLI.
   - `make4ht` CLI.

1. Run `npm run docker:stop` to stop the server when you are done or if you want to switch to debug mode.

## Debugging the development server

### Debugging the container

Run `npm run docker:shell` to access the filesystem of the running Docker image with a terminal prompt.

### Debugging code with Chrome

1. Run `npm run docker:debug` to start the development server in debug mode.
1. Go to `chrome://inspect` in the Chrome browser.
1. Open the dedicated tools for Node. These tools provide a console, the ability to inspect source code, etc.

### Debugging code with Visual Studio Code

1. Run `npm run docker:debug` to start the development server in debug mode.
1. In VSCode, select the `Run and Debug` tab in the left hand column. Click the cog icon at the top of the opened column and add the following `launch.json` file:
   ```
   {
      "version": "0.2.0",
      "configurations": [
         {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "attach",
            "name": "Docker: Attach",
            "port": 9229,
            "address": "localhost",
            "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/server",
            "remoteRoot": "/app",
            "outFiles": [
               "${workspaceFolder}/build/app/**/*.js"
            ],
         }
      ]
   }
   ```
1. With the `Run and Debug` column open, click the play icon at the top to run `Docker: Attach`. At this point, you should be able to set and hit breakpoints in the source code of the server.

### Debugging tests with Visual Studio Code

1. Install the 'Remote Containers' extension.
1. Click on the new icon that will show in the left hand column with a hover tip of 'Remote Explorer.'
1. Existing containers on your machine should be shown. If it isn't already started, run `npm run docker:start` to make sure that Docker containers are running.
1. Hover over the `linkage-api` container and click the `Attach to Container` button (a folder with a `+`).
1. A new VSCode window will open that is attached and reading from the `linkage-api` container. It'll be blank, though, as you'll need to specify which directory you'd like to open in the container. Open the `/app` directory (where the `server` folder is mounted).
1. The VSCode instance running in the container will have its own unique set of extensions. To run tests, install the `Jest` extension. This should create a new entry in the left hand column of VSCode that looks like an Erlenmeyer flask (aka a beaker). If the entry doesn't show, you may need to close and re-open VSCode.
1. The extension will take a moment to discover tests, but after that process is done, you should be up and running to set breakpoints and debug tests.

## Testing

This project uses Jest to tests functionalities.
.

- Run `npm run test` to execute all tests.
- Run `npm run test:ci` to execute all tests intended for the continuous integration workflow.
- Run `npm run unit-test` to execute unit tests.
- Run `npm run integration-test` to execute integration tests.

## GitHub Actions

This repository leverages GitHub Actions to run continuous integration scripts. You can debug these scripts locally thanks to a tool called [act](https://github.com/nektos/act).

For instance, the command below locally executes a dry run of the `server-tests` GitHub Action as if it received a `pull_request` event:

```
sudo act pull_request -W .github/workflows/server-tests.yml -n
```

> **Note** `act` must be executed at the root level of the repository to avoid errors that are essentially false negative.

## Document generation

### Document preparation with LaTeX

You may edit and compile `.tex` files using a graphic user interface like [Texmaker LaTeX editor](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html). Texmaker requires to install a [Tex distribution](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) on your machine in order to compile your `.tex` documents.

> **Note** The recommended native Tex distribution for Mac ([MacTex](https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html)) seems to be particularly sizeable as a 4.6G download as of July 6, 2022. Similarly, compiling files can be a lengthy process.

Online tools like [Papeeria](www.papeeria.com) also exist to edit and compile `.tex` files in your browser.
