  \section{Dual-Duct VAV Terminal Unit - Snap-Acting Control}

  \ifx\ParamsOptional\true
  \begin{itshape} \\
    Snap-acting control logic is the first choice among the various DD contorl schemes, as it is the most efficient and does not require DD boxes with mixing sections that have a high pressure drop. It allows use of dual standard airflow sensors, one at each inlet, with standard pressure independent logic blocks; alternatively, a single discharge airflow sensors may be used.

    However, snap-acting logic is not ideal for \coo control because it can cause the zone to oscillate between cooling and heating. This occurs when the \coo control pushes the Vmin\* up to Vcool-max; at that point, temperature control is lost, and if the space is overcooled it will be pushe dinto heating, where it will be overheated, then back again. If \coo demand-controlled ventillation is required, the mixing logic described in the next section should be used.

    This logic assumes no ability to mix hot and cold air to prevent overly low supply air temperatures that may occur on systems with high outdoor airflows and no preheat coil. So a preheat coil is likely to be required on such systems if mixed air temperature can fall below 7°C (45°F) or so in winter.

    Note that snap-acting logic can also be problematic for zones with high minimums, because the room itself is acting as the mixing box.

    Because no cold-duct air is supplied during heating mode, the heating system must include ventilation air either with direct outdoor air intake or indirectly via transfer air from overventilated spaces on the same system. Refer to Standard 62.1-2016 and Standard 62.1 User’s Manual.

    \item See \autoref{subsec:ZoneMinimumAirflowSetpoint} for zone minimum airflow setpoint Vmin, maximum cooling airflow setpoint Vcoolmax, and the zone maximum heating airflow setpoint Vheat-max.
    \item Active setpoint shall vary depending on the mode of the Zone Group the zone is a part of (see Table 5.11.4).

  % The engineer must select between ventilation logic options:
  % If there are airflow sensors at both inlets to the box, use Section 5.11.5.1 and delete Section 5.11.5.2.
  % If there is a single airflow sensor at the box discharge, use Section 5.11.5.2 and delete Section 5.11.5.1.

  \subsection{Temperature and Damper Control with Dual Inlet Airflow Sensors}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item When the Zone State is cooling, the cooling-loop output shall reset the active cold duct airflow setpoint from the minimum endpoint to cooling maximum setpointendpoint. The cold duct damper shall be modulated by a control loop to maintain the measured cooling airflow at the active cold duct airflow setpoint. The hot duct damper shall be closed.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item If cold-deck supply air temperature from the air handler is greater than room temperature, the active cold duct airflow setpoint shall be no higher than the minimum endpoint.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item When the Zone State is deadband, the active cold duct and hot ductairflow setpoints shall be their last setpoints just before entering deadband. In other words, when going from cooling to deadband, the active cold duct airflow setpoint is equal to the minimum endpoint, and the active hot duct airflow setpoint is zero. When going from heating to deadband, the active hot duct airflow setpoint is equal to the minimum endpoint, and the active cold duct airflow setpoint is zero. This results in a snap-action switch in the damper setpoint as indicated in Figures 5.11.5-1 and 5.11.5-2.

    \ifx\ParamsOptional\true
      \begin{itshape}
      With snap-acting logic, the deadband airflow is maintained by the damper from the last mode, rather than always using the cold deck, as per the mixing sequences below. This is to avoid instability when transitioning from heating to deadband.
      \end{itshape}
    \fi

    \item When the Zone State is heating, the heating-loop output shall reset the active hot duct  airflow setpoint from the minimum endpoint to heating maximum setpointendpoint. The hot duct damper shall be modulated by a control loop to maintain the measured heating airflow at the active hot duct airflow setpoint. The cold duct damper shall be closed.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item If hot-deck supply air temperature from the air handler is less than room temperature, the active hot duct airflow setpoint shall be no higher than the minimum endpoint.
    \end{enumerate}

  \end{enumerate}
  \else
    \subsection{Temperature and Damper Control with a Single Discharge Airflow Sensor}

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item When the Zone States is cooling, the cooling-loop output shall reset the active discharge airflow setpoint from the minimum endpoint to cooling maximum setpointendpoint. The cold duct damper shall be modulated by a control loop to maintain the measured discharge airflow at active discharge airflow setpoint. The hot duct damper shall be closed.
      \item When the Zone State is deadband, the active discharge airflow setpoint shall be the minimum endpoint, maintained by the damper that was operative just before entering deadband. The other damper shall remain closed. In other words, when going from cooling to deadband, the cold duct damper shall maintain the discharge airflow at the minimum setpointendpoint, and the hot duct damper shall be closed. When going from heating to deadband, the hot duct damper shall maintain the discharge airflow at the zone minimum setpointendpoint, and the cold duct damper shall be closed. This results in a snap-action switch in the damper setpoint as indicated in Figures 5.11.5-1 and 5.11.5-2.
      \item When the Zone State is heating, the heating-loop output shall reset the active discharge airflow setpoint from the minimum endpoint to heating maximum setpointendpoint. The hot duct damper shall be modulated by a control loop to maintain the measured discharge airflow at the active discharge airflow setpoint. The cooling damper shall be closed.
    \end{enumerate}

  % This concludes the section where the airflow sensor configuration is selected.
  % When the sequences are complete, only one of Section 5.11.5.1 and Section 5.11.5.2 should remain. The other section should be deleted, along with these flag notes.

  \subsection{Overriding Sections 5.11.5.1 and 5.11.5.2 Logic (to Avoid Backflow from One Duct to the Other)}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If heating air handler is not proven on, the heating damper shall be closed.
  \item If cooling air handler is not proven on, the cooling damper shall be closed.
